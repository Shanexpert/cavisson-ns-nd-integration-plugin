Group|AWS Lambda Stats|11044|vector|6|0|AWS Metrics|AccountName>Region|AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.

Graph|AWS Lambda Concurrent Executions|1|scalar|sample|-|-|0|NA|-1|-1|NA|NA|Measures the average of concurrent executions for a given function at a given point in time.
Graph|AWS Lambda Duration (ms)|2|scalar|sample|-|-|0|NA|-1|-1|NA|NA|Measures the average elapsed wall clock time from when the function code starts executing as a result of an invocation to when it stops executing
Graph|AWS Lambda Errors|3|scalar|sample|-|-|0|NA|-1|-1|NA|NA|Measures the number of invocations that failed due to errors in the function (response code 4XX).
Graph|AWS Lambda Invocations|4|scalar|sample|-|-|0|NA|-1|-1|NA|NA|Measures the number of times a function is invoked in response to an event or invocation API call.
Graph|AWS Lambda Throttles|5|scalar|sample|-|-|0|NA|-1|-1|NA|NA|Measures the number of Lambda function invocation attempts that were throttled due to invocation rates exceeding the customer's concurrent limits (error code 429). Failed invocations may trigger a retry attempt that succeeds
Graph|AWS Lambda Unreserved Concurrent Executions|6|scalar|sample|-|-|0|NA|-1|-1|NA|NA|Measures the sum of the concurrency of the functions that don't have a custom concurrency limit specified.
