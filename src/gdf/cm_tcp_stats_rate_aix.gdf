Graph|Window Probe Packets/Sec|6|scalar|rate|-|-|0|A|-1|-1|NA|NA|The count of window probe packets.(per second) (Window probe packets are typically sent by a sender when the receiver last advertised a zero receive window, to see if the window has opened up now).
Graph|Window Update Packets/Sec|7|scalar|rate|-|-|0|A|-1|-1|NA|NA|Window Update Packet (per second). TCP uses a sliding window flow control protocol.

The sending host can send only up to that amount of data before it must wait for an acknowledgment and window update from the receiving host.
